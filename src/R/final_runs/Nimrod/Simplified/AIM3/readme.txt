Lots of data meant I ran out of RAM on my PC pretty quickly - rather than deal with how slow
RStudio is on the HPC, I decided to start a new project, saving R objects often as .RDS and only keeping
what I needed in memory at a time
AIM3-R contains old analysis from when I was using G matrices and experimenting with eigentensor analysis and
relative eigenanalysis to compare trait variation between populations.
