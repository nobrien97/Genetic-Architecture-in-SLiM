Nimrod contains new R scripts I used in the HPC to call SLiM to run through R
Old contains job array scripts to do the same but without the Nimrod system
LHC_generation.R contains the hypercube generation code, for both the old and simplified models.
Missing models finds which model-seed combinations were missed the first time through with the Nimrod system
so I could rerun them (this was for the Null model)
