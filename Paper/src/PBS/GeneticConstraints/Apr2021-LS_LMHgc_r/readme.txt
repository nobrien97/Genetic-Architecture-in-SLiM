This test changes levels of locisigma (1 or 10), genetic constraint (genome wide being low, medium, or high), and recombination (0, 0.2, 0.5)
48 total seeds/replicates

SFS_Test showed 24 replicates taking an hour and 5 minutes 30 seconds for 95000 generations
Expand out to 150000 generations, get 131/76hrs/ 1.72hrs
48 replicates should take double that, 3.447hrs (131/38)
18 total levels to do in this factorial design, with 48 replicates each
18 * 131/38 = 62.05 hours total if using 1 node
With 4 nodes, that's 15.5 hours total
